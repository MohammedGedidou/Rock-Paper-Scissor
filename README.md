# Rock-Paper-Scissor
I created a Rock-Paper-Scissor game which uses the camera as a hand detector to play against the the Computer


# How to start the Game:
to run the game you must have python 3.9 because the 3.11 does not support the mediapipe library 

then you need to download the used libraries

after that you can simply start the game with the space bary

to end the game press the ESC key
